# Projects
This repository contains several of my projects from my college classes. 

The Data Algorithms and Structures folder contains my class projects for implementing my own data structures, including the circular dynamic array, the red-black tree, the binary heap, and the fibonacci heap data structures. These projects are in C++ and consist of class that can be utilized inside of another file. It can be compiled using:
```
g++ <filename.cpp> -std=c++11
```
Although these data structures are already well-implemented, implementing these data structures on my own helped to enhance my understanding of how these data structures function as well as what common sources of error may be. Additinally, it has served to give me a great deal of respect for those who design data structures such as these.

The Software Engineering folder contains the code for the final project as well as additional information about the project. A manual can be found here:
