<h2>Short Paragraph</h2>
    <p>	The ChocoAn Data center is strictly in charge of software actions the actors (provider, timer, manager, and operator) can perform. Other financial-related software actions will be performed through a third-party organization, Acme Accounting Services. The glossary includes all terms related to the elements and use cases in our UML case diagram. Our UML case diagram shows the relationship of the ChocoAn Data center’s use cases to its actors and the relationship of use cases to use cases. </p>
  <br><br><br>

<h2>Glossary</h2> 
    <p>
        
1.) <b>Bills ChocAn</b> - After a service is provided, the provider bills chocAn by verifying the member helped, date and service number. 
    <br>
        
2.) <b>ChocAn ID Card</b> - A plastic card that has the member's name and a nine-digit member number
    <br>
3.) <b>End of Week Report(sent to Member)</b>- Contains member name, member number, member street address, city, state, zip code, and for each service: Date of service, provider name and service name
    <br>
4.) End of Week Report(sent to Provider)- Contains provider name, number / id, street address, city, state, zip code and for each service: date of service, date and time that data was received by the computer, member name, member number, service code, fee to be paid. Also, Total number of consultations with members and total fee for week
    <br>
5.) <b>Interactive Mode</b>- Configuration of the ChocAn data center that allows operators to add new members, delete members and update records. Also allows operators to do the same for provider. ChocAn data center is run in this mode during the day.
        <br>
6.) Manager - Works with the ChocAn Data Center with main focus on the billing/fees side of the company
        <br>
7.) <b>Member number</b> - nine-digit unique number to identify member. Used by member to validate membership in ChocAn.
        <br>
8.) <b>Operators</b> - ChocAn workers that can add, delete and modify ChocAn memberships
        <br>
9.) <b>Provider </b> - Assists customer with needs while operating with ChocAn devices to document and bill member interactions
        <br>
        10.) <b>Provider</b> directory- alphabetically ordered list of service names and corresponding service codes and fees; sent to the provider as an email attachment
        <br>
        
11.) <b>Provider number</b> - unique identifying number assigned to each provider.
        <br>
12.) <b>Provider Terminal </b> - A specially designed computer terminal (similar to POS systems) that each provider needs to use in order to serve members of ChocAn.
        <br>
13.) <b>Service Code</b>- six digit code that corresponds to the type of service provided. For example, 598470 is the code associated with a dietitian.
        <br>

Finally, the total number of providers who provided services, the total number of consultations, and the overall fee total are printed.
        <br>
15.) <b>Timer</b> - At midnight on Friday, the timer activates the main accounting procedure <br>

16.) <b>EFT Reports</b> -  A record consisting of electronic funds transfer (EFT) data is then written to a disk; banking computers will later ensure that each provider’s bank account is credited with the appropriate amount. <br>

17.) <b>Operator number</b> -  unique identifying number assigned to each operator that is used to verify their role. <br>
18.) <b>Manager number</b> -  unique identifying number assigned to each manager that is used to verify their role. <br>

    <h2>User Case Descriptions</h2>
 



        
<p> <mark><b>Title: Member Validation</b></mark> <br>
<b>Context</b>: Before providing the health care service to the member, the provider needs to swipe the member’s card at the provider terminal, validating that the prospective customer is indeed a member of ChocAn. <br>
<b>Actors</b> Member gives card to Provider; Provider swipes card <br>
<b>Main Success Scenario:</b><br>
1.) The member gives the provider their nine-digit ChocAn member ID card. <br>
2.) Provider swipes the card or enters the number at the provider terminal. <br>
3.) The provider terminal communicates with the ChocAn Data Center which verifies the member number. <br>
4.)The word “Validated” appears on the one-line display. <br>
5.)The health care provider now provides the service to the member.<br>
6.)Exit system <br>
    <b>Extensions</b>: <br>
    &emsp;4a. The number is not valid <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;4a.1. The reason is displayed (invalid number or member suspended)
</p>       <br><br>
        
        
<p>
  <mark><b>Title: Bill ChocAn</b></mark> <br>
<b>Context</b>:After a member has completed a session with a provider, the provider swipes the members ID card. If verified, the provider documents the date of the appointment and accesses the provider directory to look up a six digit code indicating the service provided. The provider then enters the code and verifies the service recorded in the system. The system then displays the corresponding fee and displays it to the providers terminal. To verify the provider enters the date, basic member info, and the service provided.
 <br>
<b>Actors</b> Provider <br>
<b>Main Success Scenario:</b> <br>
	1.The terminal validates the member <br>
2. After a service, the member hands the provider their card <br>
3. The provider swipes or enters the members card<br>
4. When VALIDATED appears, the provider enters the date the service was provided, given by MM-DD-YYYY.<br>
5. The provider accesses the Provider Directory to find the corresponding six-digit service code to the service provided<br>
6. The provider enters the code<br>
   &emsp;  6.1. System displays up to a 20 character description of the code entered and gives the provider a chance to verify<br>
    &emsp; 6.2 If an invalid code is entered, an error message is displayed<br>
    &emsp; 6.3 Provider can add comments if needed <br>
7. Fee associated for entered service is displayed to the provider’s terminal <br>
8. To verify, the provider enters the current date and time, the date the service was provided, member name and number, service code and fee to be paid<br>
9. At the end of the week, the provider totals the fees to verify how much money is to be paid by ChocAn <br>
10. Exit system <br>
