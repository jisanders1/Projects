Short Paragraph
	
	The ChocoAn Data center is strictly in charge of software actions the actors (provider, timer, manager, and operator) can perform. Other financial related software actions will be performed through a third-party organization, Acme Accounting Services. The glossary includes all terms related to the elements and use cases in our UML case diagram. Our UML case diagram shows the relationship of the ChocoAn Data centerâ€™s use cases to its actors and relationship of use cases to use cases.
