Computerized sections include running the main accounting procedure that the Timer initiates at 12am on Friday. This process performed by the computer includes sending the provider, member, EFT, and summary reports to the printer. The hardware required will be the disks to store the data, printers for the reports, provider terminals and card readers. ChocoAn system supports Acme Accounting by storing the information Acme system needs for its financial procedure. The EFT system needs Provider information which the ChocAn system will have. Users of the systems will interact with it as follows: the operator can update member or  provider records; providers can request the provider directory and bill ChocAn which includes member validation. Manager can request any of the individual reports at any time.
